1. This website provides a creative and interactive experience where users can draw and generate raindrop effects through direct interaction.
2. Use of Masking Effects The website applies mask filters to the background image based on user-drawn lines and raindrops, creating various visual effects such as blurring or sharpening parts of the image.
3. Smooth Tween Animations During Masking The raindrop effect is implemented using animation functions like Tween and Ease, ensuring a natural flow and uninterrupted animations even during masking operations.
4. Minimizing Performance Degradation from Repeated Masking Operations Optimized graphic processing is applied to minimize performance degradation while frequently updating the canvas and mask filters.
